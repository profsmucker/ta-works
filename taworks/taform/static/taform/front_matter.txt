<h1>Management Sciences TA Application Form</h1>
<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>Within the Department of Management Sciences the Teaching Assistantship is 
not an award but an employment assignment where the applicant's relevant academic 
background and communication skills are primary considerations. There is no 
guarantee that an applicant will receive a teaching assistantship.</p>

<p>Your application is for a teaching assistantship and not for a specific 
course's teaching assistant position.  If you receive a teaching assignment, your 
assignment to a course will be based on the needs of the department and your 
capabilities. This application provides you a means to provide your course 
preferences, but ultimately, TA positions are awarded based on many factors, including:</p>

<ul>
    <li>the course instructor rankings of applicants</li>
    <li>the teaching support needs within the department and actual enrolment numbers</li>
    <li>the applicant's preferred courses</li>
    <li>the applicant's verbal communication skills (delivery of tutorials 
    require good verbal skills)</li>
    <li>the qualifications and suitability of applicant</li>
    <li>satisfactory completion of the ExpecTAtions workshop</li>
</ul>

<h2>Requirements</h2>

<p>There are several requirements that must be met by a student to qualify for 
employment as a teaching assistant:</p>

<ul>
    <li>It is a requirement of the Faculty of Engineering that only those students 
    who have successfully completed the workshop, ExpecTAtions,
    are eligible to hold a TA.  (Because the first workshop is offered
    at the end of the fall term, <it>new</it> students may apply for
    for a fall term TA prior to taking ExpecTAtions.  However, this requirement is
    enforced for all existing students and in other terms for all students.)</li>

            leave early for vacation at the end of the term without permission of the instructor.</li>
