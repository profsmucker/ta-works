<h2>Applying for a TA position</h2>

<p>Before applying, please read information below thoroughly. 
It is your responsibility to ensure you understand the responsibilities and 
time commitment of a Teaching Assistant. See below for application deadlines.</p>

<p>Within the Department of Management Sciences the Teaching Assistantship is 
not an award but an employment assignment where the applicant's relevant academic 
background and communication skills are primary considerations. There is no 
guarantee that an applicant will receive a teaching assistantship.</p>

<p>Your application is for a teaching assistantship and not for a specific 
course's teaching assistant position.  If you receive a teaching assignment, 
your assignment to a course will be based on the needs of the department and 
your capabilities. This application provides you a means to provide your course 
preferences, but ultimately, TA positions are awarded based on many factors:</p>

<ul>
	<li>the course instructor rankings of applicants</li>
	<li>the teaching support needs within the department and actual enrolment numbers</li>
	<li>the applicant's preferred courses</li>
	<li>the applicant's verbal communication skills (delivery of tutorials requires good verbal skills)</li>
	<li>the qualifications and suitability of applicant</li>
	<li>satisfactory completion of the ExpecTAtions workshop</li>
	<li>consultation with applicant's supervisor (if applicable) and department graduate coordinator</li>
</ul>

<h2>Requirements of Teaching Assistants in Management Sciences</h2>

<p>There are several requirements that must be met by a student to qualify for employment as a teaching assistant:</p>

<ul>
	<li>It is a requirement of the Faculty of Engineering that only those 
    students who have successfully completed the workshop, ExpecTAtions, 
    are eligible to hold a TA.</li>
	<li>Teaching assistants must be currently enrolled as students.</li>
	<li>Teaching assistants must be fully available for their assigned course:
	<ul>
	<li>At a minimum, the TA must be available during <a target="_blank" href=https://uwaterloo.ca/management-sciences/courses-graduate-and-undergraduate-studies>times 
    scheduled</a> for the course's tutorial and labs. Some instructors may need 
    a TA available during lectures for in class exams, etc.</li>
	<li>You must be available to proctor the final exam.</li>
	<li>As a TA, you must be available from the first day of the first month of 
    the term until the last day of the last month of the term. Note that the 
    end of the term extends past final exams. You may not leave early for 
    vacation at the end of the term without permission of the instructor.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Students should not have any outstanding English Language Proficiency 
    requirements as part of their conditions of admission for their Graduate 
    Studies program.</li>
	<li>International students must have a valid study permit. You must ensure 
    that the Study Permit has not expired or will not expire during the period 
    of the Teaching Assistantship.  Please see the following website for more

    Study Permits or Immigration Status changes</a>.</li>
</ul>

 your second or third term rather than in your first term when you are adjusting 
 to the academic workload of graduate level courses under the time commitment 
 required of a Teaching Assistant. </p>
